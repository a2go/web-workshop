# 18. Sales

- Add a second model to represent a `Sale`.
  - This model is part of the "Products" domain so it does not need a new package.
- Add a migration for the new table and some seed data.
- Add two fields Sold and Revenue to the `Product` type.
- Modify the `List` and `Retrieve` queries to populate the Sold and Revenue fields.
