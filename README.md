# A2Go web-workshop
A series of progressive workshops to build webservices

### Our story so far

We have an app that says hello world!

### Client

Go to <a href="./client">The client directory</a> for instructions on how to run the client!

### Get started with Go

The quickest way to get started with Go, is install [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) (Jet Brains GoLand is nice, but not free). If you go to the [vscode-config](./vscode-config) directory, there's useful tips and settings for you to get started with.

## Why

A2 Go, the developer meetup, is a forum for people working in or around Ann Arbor with Go to discuss ideas, issues and share solutions. One of the topics of interest that we heard from our community was "Why do I hear so much about web services and Go?". These workshops are an attempt to teach, from ground zero, the how and why of web services in Go. In this case we are interpreting web services fairly broadly and we think that is good. It gives plenty of fun and interesting rabbit holes to fall into while learning.

## How to use this web-workshop

While each workshop is written with a user group meeting in mind, it could be used in another format. The git repository is structured such that you change branches for each workshop. The zero branch is a very basic hello world web application. Each branch has its own README which walks the attendee through steps to build whatever is being built in that workshop. Subsequent branches pick up where the previous workshop left off. Our goal is for someone with little to no Go experience to be able to start this workshop at step zero.

To get started, clone this repo and change to the [workshop_0](a2go/web-workshop/blob/workshop_0/README.md) branch.
