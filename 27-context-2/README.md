# 27. Context Part 2
## The Return of Context

We are now using middleware chains and a custom handler. We are also making
greater use of context for passing values. As we continue to expand this
program we will find relying on `request.Context` and `request.WithContext` to
be annoying.

- Add `ctx context.Context` as the first argument in the `web.Handler` type.
- Make the adapter function in `web.go` pass down the first context which was
  derived from `r.Context()`.
- Anything else using `r.Context()` should instead use the passed `ctx`.
- Make everything compile.
