// seeds is a string constant containing all of the queries needed to get the
// db seeded to a useful state for development.
//
// Using a constant in a .go file is an easy way to ensure the queries are part
// of the compiled executable and avoids pathing issues with the working
// directory. It has the downside that it lacks syntax highlighting and may be
// harder to read for some cases compared to using .sql files. You may also
// consider a combined approach using a tool like packr or go-bindata.
//
// Note that database servers besides PostgreSQL may not support running
// multiple queries as part of the same execution so this single large constant
// may need to be broken up.
