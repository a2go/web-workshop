# 34. Distributed Tracing

In a microservice environment it can be hard to see the execution path of a
single request across multiple services. The tracing libraries / products we
are using support propogating context across requests so they are correlated as
part of the same overall request.

Look for a Trace ID on incoming requests and add a TraceID to outgoing requests.
